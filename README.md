## What is this tool for?
This tool is made to transform syllables written in Latin script into cuneiform signs

## HOWTO
In the first text area write some syllables which you want to transform to cuneiform signs.

Recommendation is to type the signs in <b>lower</b> case. All the signs should be divided only by a <b>space</b>, don't use special signs like ":" or "."
  
Use the conventional rules of CDLI:
- "Š" will be "sz", "Á"="A2", "È"="E3", "Ḫ"="H"

Use "-" to write the complicated signs:
- "URU×UL" will be "uru-ul", "AŠ.AŠ"="asz-asz"
  
Use the sign "\*" to write the inversum:
- "NAGAinversum" would be "naga\*"

## FAQ
