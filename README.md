## What is this tool for?
This tool is made to transform syllables written in Latin script into cuneiform signs

## HOWTO
In the first text area write some syllables which you want to transform to cuneiform signs.

Please note, I recommend you typing the signs in <b>lower</b> case. All the signs should be divided only by a <b>space</b>, please, don't use special signs like ":" or "."
  
Use the conventional rules of CDLI!
- "Š" will be "sz", "Á"="A2", "È"="E3", "Ḫ"="H".

Use "-" to write the complicated signs.
- "URU×UL" will be "uru-ul", "AŠ.AŠ"="asz-asz".
  
Use the sign "\*" to write the inversum
- "NAGAinversum" would be "naga\*"

## FAQ
### 1) What signs can I enter?
You can use all signs from these sign lists: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cuneiform_signs" rel="nofollow">wikipedia list of cuneiform signs</a> and <a href="http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/edition2/signlist.php" rel="nofollow">ETCSL signlist</a>

### 2) I don't see signs in the result - what should I do? (Or I see something I shouldn't see)
Firstly, I recommend you to check whether you've entered it correctly. If everything seems to be right, try downloading and installing the fonts from the repository.

### 3) What is the purpose of this site? Who should use it?
